# AEMSUCA
Let's get rid of hazardous batteries and use solar power and eco friendly supercapacitors! The AEMSUCA is a 0.8x0.6 inch board for the AEM10941 Solar Harvesting IC from E-peas. It efficiently converts solar panel energy into supercapacitor charge, it even works with indoor light. It features 3.3V and 1.8V regulated outputs that are enabled when the supercapacitor has sufficient charge, and a low battery warning that informs the user of impending shutdown when the supercapacitor runs low. It easily integrates in other projects because of the castelllated via's, and when soldered onto 0.1' pitch header it fits in a bread board.

I am planning to sell this board on Tindie. If you are interested follow my project on Hackaday using the link below.
